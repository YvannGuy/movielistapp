*** API ***

- Setup & test API on Firebase
  - Follow this recording: https://www.loom.com/share/5406d86390fa49f889a35581c657fc5d?sid=6eae4360-6ac4-4c4a-b976-8c4013a79b69

  - Test all the endpoints with Postman:
    POST /movies.json
    GET /movies.json
    GET /movies/:movieId.json
    PATCH /movies/:movieId.json (partial update)
    DELETE /movies/:movieId.json

- Create some initial data (4 movies)
    - title
    - description
    - year
    - casting (eg. "Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt")
    - imageURL (eg. "https://imdb.com/images/ms-andmr.jpg")

*** React ***

- Modify your React app so that it displays a list of movies coming from your own API:
  - Modify getAllMovies() so that you get the list of movies from your own api
  - note: remember that Firebase returns an object, so need to convert it to an array (as shown in the video)
